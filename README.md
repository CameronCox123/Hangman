# Hangman
Plays Hangman with the user by picking a random word in a database of 28 words. 

To play hangman, run the program, and type into the terminal the letter you would like to guess
After you have completed a round and either guessed the word or ran out of guesses the terminal will ask to play again
The game only runs again if you enter the character y into the terminal
All other inputs will end the game.

# Modification: 
You can easily challenge yourself by uploading a different database of words into the word_list variable.
Just make sure each word is a string stored in the list
You can also adjust the difficulty by changing the try_count variable to let you have more or less guesses
